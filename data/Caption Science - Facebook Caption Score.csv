"Charlotte Folk has initiated a recall after customers raised issues about a misspelling on one of their products.
Over the weekend, several customers aired complaints about receiving a Redefining Sweater in Blue or Green that had a misspelled word. Instead of “redefining,” the sweater read “redifining”.
Fans of BINI, who collaborated with Charlotte Folk for this drop, pointed out that even the sweaters Stacy and Jhoanna wore had the same misspelling.
The local streetwear brand quickly issued a statement that they will be “initiating a recall for all Redefining Sweaters in Blue and Green due to a quality control oversight.”
Customers who have received this faulty product can expect an email from Charlotte Folk. The brand also promised “compensation options for the inconvenience caused.”
“We recognize that none of this is okay and we're truly sorry for the disappointment. We're fully committed to making this right and ensuring that your experience ends on a positive note. Thank you so much for understanding,” the statement ended.
Netizens praised the brand for quickly taking action. “Kudos to team CF for admitting the lapse on their end and for taking action and doing this product recall. 👌🏻,” an X (formerly Twitter) user wrote.
“I mean as they should di ba... pero in fairness naman talaga sa [Charlotte Folk], nakikinig sila sa customers nila,” another said.
Established in 2018 by Jan Charlotte Venzon, Charlotte Folk is a local streetwear brand specializing in cozy yet stylish pieces for the “urban muse.” The brand recently collaborated with the Nation’s Girl Group BINI for its latest collection.

Before we formed the concept to start our own movement, we were inspired by a combination of some rookies and pioneer brands on the local scene. We were struck by their visions, standards, and how they contribute and show their identity and purpose to the scene, not just in terms of outstanding products.
They all have different creative styles, but they all have the same goal which is to rise up. These brands are examples of why a brand should be more than just labels and products, but also a movement and an important part of one's lifestyle.

"NASIRA ULO KO DITO: DBTK x H&M 🤯
Nakakaproud maging parte ng PH Clothing Brand Community!
Malapit na talaga yung araw na hindi na peke o mababang klase kapag narinig ang salitang 'LOKAL' at nakakaproud dahil ang hiphop/streetwear scene sa bansa ang may pinakamatinding ambag dito.
Hiphop/streetwear scene na dating inaasar na pormahang mga dugyot daw. Pero makikita mo ngayon, maski Lola, Lolo, Nanay o Tatay ay may mga nagsusuot na ng local brands.
Malayo na ang narating pero malayo pa talaga, sabi nga ni Sir Douglas Brocklehurst, halos 2% pa lang ang nagsusuot ng local brands sa bansa. Malaki pa ang misyon! Malaki pa ang pangarap!
At darating yung araw na mawawala na yung salitang #SupportLocalBrand na para bang nagmamakaawa dahil lahat bilang isang bansa, proud na proud tayo sa mga locally-produced merch!
Tindihan pa natin ang kalidad! Magkakaroon din ng mga Pinoy Brand na tatangkilikin ng buong mundo! Sigurado ako dun!
Padayon, Filipino Clothing Brand Community!

"""I’m collaborating with our good friends over at Instinct Studios to produce a tee to let you wear your love for toy collection and fashion on your sleeve!
Instinct Studios has been around since 2019. This unapologetic brand is young, but they've changed the local streetwear scene for the better. It believes in the potential of local artists to use textile and fabric as a vessel to express themselves. The Instinct Studios team has been dedicated to putting the work of local artists and designers in the forefront by producing high-quality apparel with one goal in mind — to make you look too good to be ignored! 
Instinct Studios have worked with different names and brands such as NOBRVND, Pawssion Project, and more. Each partnership has been instilled with advocacy while never compromising their steadfast brand of style.
I've always wanted to work with the people from Instinct Studios as I am a fan of streetwear/designwear, myself. Not to mention, one of my missions as a multifaceted artist is to dabble in apparel design, too. This collab is a creative outlet for us to maximize what we can do and broaden our perspectives as artists.
Projects like this help us foster our next career milestones to life and, most importantly, share our love of toys with a growing community. It's a means for us to escape the isolation of the global pandemic that we're living through right now. Plus, it's another way for us to meet like-minded individuals who share the excitement that I have for artisanship. 
That's why I'm thrilled to work with them as a fellow creative agent that's also obsessed with all things artistic. They're also sponsoring me at Art Toys PH's MADBOX 30: Online Custom Show, a custom art toy show on June 24 to 30, 2021, at Solid Toys Greenhills. It's an event that strengthens the toy community through socializing and shining the spotlight on great toy designers. International and local toy lovers absolutely can't miss it. BTW, this is also one of the things that helped make this collaboration happen.
I've always admired similar collaborations from big brands like Supreme x Medicom Toy or maybe even KAWS x Uniqlo x Sesame Street. Not to get all #PEENOISE PRIDE, but the Filipino market deserves an accessible toy and streetwear collaboration that they can truly call their own. That's why it's important for us to bring this collaboration to the local hypebeast scene. 
And besides? What better way to express your love for toys and fashion than wearing a flashy shirt that'll turn heads! 
Show exclusive tee available at https://instinct.ph/collect.../artcade-jl-x-instinct-studios & at the show venue for 895PHP. "" -Artcade JL 
Drop by our physical display this June 24-30 at Unbox Greenhills and see the amazing works of our talented artists.

"Founded in 2019, @calleconph was initially an effort to unite the local urban community who found their passions in local hiphop and street style. It was a roaring success as the first Calle Con gathered 32 live acts and 54 local brands to successfully intersect the two pillars of street culture.
And in 2022, after a three-year hiatus due to the pandemic, Calle Con came back stronger as a two-day festival with 50 of the best live artists in the game, 80 local streetwear brands present, 10 streetwear fashion shows, a skate tournament, and a dance battle. With Filipinos ready to connect through music and style once again, we expect a bigger and better Calle Con this 2023.

"I can’t believe I’m now part of Bench Body of Work!😍☺️ I grew up in the province, where Bench was the most popular clothing brand. And I’ve always been a fan of Richard Gomez, the first ever Bench model in the Philippines! It was my dream back then to one day be part of Bench, and now it’s finally happening. ☺️🙏🏾 Dreams really do come true! You just have to be patient and wait for the right time.😊
.
And now, I’ll be walking in the Bench Fashion Show this March 21! Walking in a Bench fashion show has always been one of my dreams, and now it’s becoming a reality! Who would have thought that a skinny provincial boy who used to be bullied would one day walk for Bench Body of Work? 🥹
.
The first time I saw my photo at the Bench flagship store in BGC, it felt so surreal. I used to dream of seeing my picture displayed in a Bench store, and now it’s finally there!🥹🙏🏾 This whole experience feels unreal, and I’m so excited for what’s to come!
.
Thank you, @benchtm @benchbodyph , for this opportunity and for making my dream come true!😊🙏🏾💪🏾 #benchbodyofwork #bodywork #bodyofwork

"BATIK FABRIC IS NOT FILIPINO.  Though proliferating in Philippine cultural shops and even used as a brand by sellers who advocate Filipino textiles… please know that Batik (as a fabric and as a dyeing technique) is Indonesian and Malaysian. It is a traditional craft that is also handed down in Singapore, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
It is NOT Filipino.
Batik (like other textiles) can be used IN Filipiniana style clothes (like to make butterfly sleeves), but the textile is not ours.
The ancient art of making Batik (wax-resist dyeing) originated in  Java, Indonesia.  Batik is a dyeing technique that uses resin and fabric dye to create patterns and designs. 
Central Javanese designs are influenced by traditional patterns and colors. Batik from the north coast of Java is influenced by Chinese culture, bearing bright colors and more intricate flower and cloud designs.
This art found modern renditions in Malaysia  where most popular motifs are leaves, flowers and geometrical designs with colors that are  lighter and more vibrant than Javanese batik.
The batik pieces for sale in Mindanao are imported from those countries, often arriving by boat from nieghboring islands.
To say that batik is Filipino is uninformed and is cultural misappropriation.

"#FromTheArchives: Kathryn Bernardo Official is no stranger to changing into multiple outfits in one day and trying on different fashion trends; it is, after all, a part of her job as one of the country's most sought-after actresses.

"Since 2016, @purveyrfair has been a local gathering rooted on retail pop-ups that features many different creative communities. And through these communities and their distinct expressions we have continuously experienced an undeniable inspiring energy in the past eight fairs. It has been a beautiful intersection of commerce, culture and creativity.
PURVEYR Fair is an amalgamation of different cultures, inspirations, aesthetics, and ideas — from street artists, streetwear brands, fashion labels, homeware concepts, tattoo shops, barber collectives, and more. This diversity in ideologies is the main motivation for this year’s PURVEYR Fair visuals.
To express this idea, the @PURVEYR team worked with designer Kristian Henson (@kristian_henson) to create this year’s @purveyrfair identity — a concoction of many different elements that represent our team’s belief on diversity and its role in keeping the fair vibrant, creative, and inspiring.
Today, we formally launch the tickets to #PURVEYRFair2023 for guests who would love to join us in this two-day gathering on September 2-3, 2023 happening at Metrotent Convention Center, Pasig City. You can visit the link on our bio for the ticket link or by going straight to purveyr.helixpay.ph

"Filipino streetwear has grown so much since we started in 2012—from a bunch of small independent brands then, we’re now seeing a flourishing scene with countless local brands and concepts.
With this, we are honored to be able to highlight the community through a t-shirt exhibit featuring a few Filipino streetwear brands. Thank you to our friends at @iloveglorietta for letting us use this space to commemorate the community we serve and work with.
“A Peek Into Filipino Streetwear” T-Shirt Exhibit is only scratching the surface, but we hope that it will inspire viewers to dig deeper — support the brands featured, discover other homegrown brands, and get a sense of how Filipinos can be very creative through streetwear, design and fashion.
You can visit the exhibit from this weekend until May 1 at the Glorietta Activity Center.  View t-shirts from @nobodyclothing, @dontblamethekids, @proudrace, @thankyouph, @snk.atk, @episodes.tv, @notwithstandingus, @gnarlyph, @cafecityclub, @coziestco, @dailygrindclothing, @wedrool.co, @enimalworldwild, @medium_designwear, @kltrd.ph, and @spectreltd.
Tag us when you visit the booth! Let’s show how strong the support is behind these brands and the whole community.

""We’re so excited to welcome ""Love, Bonito"" to Ayala Malls Greenbelt. This marks the Singapore-based brand’s first brick-and-mortar store in the Philippines–almost 6 years after Dione Song and I first connected over their growth aspirations in the region. The brand strives to move beyond ready-to-wear–they design ready-to-live clothes for “real lives” of women. You can also get your hands on the especially popular ""RuchedReady™"" blazers–no rolling up needed.
We have many more of these openings up our sleeve as we continue to refresh our centers across Ayala Malls … stay tuned""

"LOOK: Popular local clothing brand names Meteor Garden ABS CBN leading man Dylan Wang as their newest ambassador
Will Dylan Wang come to the Philippines as he is now an endorser of a popular clothing brand?
Dylan Wang, who plays Dao Ming Si in the latest adaptation of Taiwanese classic Meteor Garden, is the newest face of a popular clothing brand here in the Philippines. 
“So yeah. This happened. Wish granted—[Dylan Wang] is officially on our squad,” confirmed Bench on Instagram today, December 2, much to the delight of his Filipino fans.
t was in late November when the local clothing brand, who has since gone international, hinted at having Dylan as their newest global ambassador. Not surprisingly, this also led fans to eventually speculate that the Chinese actor is soon to visit the Philippines.
However, they have yet to confirm if rumors of his visit are indeed true.
Aside from Dylan, Korean actors Park Hyung Sik and Lee Min Ho, as well as American star Dylan Sprouse, were also previously named as part of the roster of their global ambassadors.",Facebook,Popular clothing brands Philippines,"June 16, 2025",https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AccPeQcw2/,5.52,-113.83,181,0,0,14,0.955,3,0,7.66%,34,0,-0.9419262079,28.05114218

"To much anticipation, and about a decade since it first established its presence at art fairs and online, #Halohalo#Halohalo#Halohalo is finally ready to open its first physical store. Making its home in a brightly lit spot on the second floor of Power Plant Mall, the brick-and-mortar space marks a fresh beginning for the popular fashion and lifestyle hub. Only a few local brands have held the same attention received by Halohalo—the brainchild of siblings #CaraSumabatLimjap#CaraSumabatLimjap#CaraSumabatLimjap and #RoccoSumabat#RoccoSumabat#RoccoSumabat. Over the years, it has gained rave reviews and developed an avid cult following around its stylish, modernised woven bags, released in drops and usually sold out within minutes. They have also expanded into clothing and home accessories through their offshoots, GoodTimes and Halohalo Home.Here’s a look inside the soft opening of Halohalo’s first-ever physical store, set to open to the public on February 26.

"BENCH
Bench started in 1987 as a small t-shirt shop in SM Makati, founded by Ben Chan. At that time, most Filipinos dressed conservatively, but Bench introduced casual and stylish clothing. The brand quickly became popular and expanded into jeans, underwear, accessories, and even fragrances.
Over the years, Bench grew beyond fashion. It opened Bench Cafés, Bench Fix Salons, and Bench Skin Expert clinics. It also brought international brands like Cotton On and Under Armour to the Philippines.
Did you know? Ben Chan comes from a family of entrepreneurs—his parents founded Liwayway Gawgaw, a well-known starch brand in the Philippines.
Today, Bench has over 600 stores in the Philippines and branches in the U.S., Middle East, and China. It has worked with global stars like Bruno Mars, Brooklyn Beckham, and Lee Min Ho. The brand also supports young designers through the Bench Design Awards.
Bench’s success is closely tied to SM, where it got its first big break. Ben Chan believes that starting small doesn’t mean staying small. Bench is proof that a Filipino brand can grow into a global name, inspiring others to dream big and push boundaries in fashion and beyond.

"LIWAYWAY GAWGAW
Liwayway Gawgaw is a brand deeply tied to Filipino history and daily life. It started in 1948 when Chinese-Filipino couple Chan Lib and See Ying saw an opportunity in cornstarch. They repackaged it into smaller, affordable packs and sold them in sari-sari stores. The name “Liwayway,” meaning “dawn,” reflected the optimism of a newly independent Philippines.
For decades, Liwayway Gawgaw was a household essential. It kept clothes crisp and fresh, perfect for baro’t saya, Americana suits, and school uniforms. In the 1960s, a popular radio jingle cemented its place in Filipino culture.
Did you know? Liwayway’s packaging has remained unchanged since 1946, making it one of the country’s most nostalgic products.
Over time, the brand expanded beyond cornstarch. In 1974, it introduced Oishi snacks, which became a massive success in the Philippines and China. The founders’ son, Ben Chan, later launched Bench, a global fashion brand. Despite this growth, Liwayway Gawgaw remains on store shelves, a tribute to its humble beginnings.
More than just a product, Liwayway Gawgaw represents resilience, tradition, and Filipino ingenuity. It is a reminder of a time when simple things, like a box of starch, held an important place in every home.

"LIWAYWAY GAWGAW
Liwayway Gawgaw is a brand deeply tied to Filipino history and daily life. It started in 1948 when Chinese-Filipino couple Chan Lib and See Ying saw an opportunity in cornstarch. They repackaged it into smaller, affordable packs and sold them in sari-sari stores. The name “Liwayway,” meaning “dawn,” reflected the optimism of a newly independent Philippines.
For decades, Liwayway Gawgaw was a household essential. It kept clothes crisp and fresh, perfect for baro’t saya, Americana suits, and school uniforms. In the 1960s, a popular radio jingle cemented its place in Filipino culture.
Did you know? Liwayway’s packaging has remained unchanged since 1946, making it one of the country’s most nostalgic products.
Over time, the brand expanded beyond cornstarch. In 1974, it introduced Oishi snacks, which became a massive success in the Philippines and China. The founders’ son, Ben Chan, later launched Bench, a global fashion brand. Despite this growth, Liwayway Gawgaw remains on store shelves, a tribute to its humble beginnings.
More than just a product, Liwayway Gawgaw represents resilience, tradition, and Filipino ingenuity. It is a reminder of a time when simple things, like a box of starch, held an important place in every home.

"HANG TEN
In 1960, a young surfer named Duke Boyd had an idea. What if there were shorts made just for surfing? He teamed up with Doris Boeck, who sewed the first boardshorts. To make them special, they added a small embroidered logo of two feet. That simple design became the start of something big.
At first, the brand was only popular among surfers in California. But as the years passed, it expanded beyond surfwear. By the 1970s, Hang Ten was selling t-shirts, hoodies, and everyday clothes. The brand reached many countries, including the Philippines in the 1980s. Many Filipinos remember shopping for Hang Ten shirts in malls like SM and Robinsons.
Did you know? In the 80s and early 2000s, Hang Ten was one of the most popular brands for students and young adults.
As time went on, more fashion brands entered the market. Hang Ten struggled to keep up. By the late 2000s, its stores in the Philippines started closing. While it still exists in other countries, for many, it remains a nostalgic memory of beach trips, casual weekends, and comfortable clothes that lasted for years.

"Dubai-based Filipino fashion designer Michael Cinco (@michaelcinco5) has called out celebrities and influencers who request free outfits from local designers while simultaneously investing heavily in prestigious luxury brands, as evidenced by his Instagram stories. His observations shed light on a broader issue: the underappreciation of Filipino designers within the local fashion community.
Many Filipino fashion designers have gained recognition, yet many others remain overlooked for their considerable talent. It is high time that local designers receive the acknowledgment they deserve, including fair compensation commensurate with their skill and creativity.

@nct wears @kikokostadinov , @rickowensonline and @postarchivefaction for their new album promotions which was posted around few days ago. Here are some of the looks. Some of the pieces are from Kiko Kostadinov SS21, PAF 3.0 and Rick Owens FW20
I'm not really familiar with NCT, The only song I like from NCT is yung from NCT U sub unit - ""7th Sense"" but them wearing my favorite designer (lol) might make me check out their new stuff when it's out. But anyway, here are some questions to think about: 
A ) What do you guys think about the outfits?
B ) From your perspective, does K-pop celebrities/Pop celebrities increase the prices of pieces in the second hand market or that is just an issue present in hip-hop a.k.a ""rapper tax""
C ) Do you gain interest at groups/artists/rappers/singers that you don't know yet who wear your favorite brands/designers and vice versa - checking out brands/clothes that your favorite music artists wear?

"#FromTheArchives: Just like any fashion girl, Andrea Brillantes isn't immune to the charm of designer pieces. ""Of course, bilang babae, nangangarap akong magkaron ng mga designer things,"" the Gen Z actress shares in this episode of Designer Favorites.
And while she could definitely afford it, Blythe has always been frugal, choosing to prioritize household needs versus personal wants. ""Mas madami akong kailangan unahing bilhin,"" she says, listing down essentials such as food and a roof over their heads.
Today, with a continuous stream of projects, a new business, and a fully-constructed family home, Blythe finally finds herself in a place where she can occasionally treat herself to luxury items—even her dream bag. Press play to discover the exact designer pieces that have brought joy to Blythe, with no regrets or second thoughts.
